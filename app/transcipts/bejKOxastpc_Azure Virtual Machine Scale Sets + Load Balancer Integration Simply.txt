hello everyone in this video we are
going to learn about virtual machine
scale sets let's say you want to deploy
a platform as a service application you
can do that with Azure app services
and depending on the load you can scale
your app service into multiple instances
just like that when you want to deploy
an application that has dependencies on
infrastructure level
you can create a virtual machine skill
set and skill set will automatically
spin up multiple virtual machines and
the scaling you don't have to worry
about it will be managed by scale set
you deployed an application to app
service here when it comes to Virtual
Machine scale sets you are not deploying
an application you are deploying a whole
image and scale sets will deploy
multiple virtual machines and all these
virtual machines will reside in one
virtual Network and today we're going to
create
a virtual machine image from scratch
and then we're going to create a virtual
machine skill set with multiple
instances of virtual machines and after
that we're going to implement a load
balancer and then we are going to allow
traffic from public internet into your
virtual machines
so the first step is creating an
application that will give us the
instance name of the virtual machine
that the application is running on in
that virtual machine skill set and I
have written this sample application and
it is almost a one line application as
you can see it's just returning the
machine name when you invoke the root of
this HTTP endpoint so the first thing
that we should do is we should deploy a
virtual machine to Azure and then we're
going to deploy this application and
then we are going to create an image for
that I'm going into Azure portal and the
first thing is we should create a
resource Group
so I'm going into resource groups and
click create here
and then I'm going to call it VM SS test
RG something like that
oh right the resource Group is ready the
first thing is I'm going to create a
virtual machine now I'm going to call it
and then the region I'm going to select
southeast Asia and image is okay the
size is okay as well username I'm going
to call it let's just enable Port 80 as
well but this is not needed because
we're just going to create this virtual
machine and we are going to extract the
image but I'm going to keep it enabled
and I'm going to go and all this
configuration I'm going to keep as
default because we're just going to use
this VM to create an image
all right after like one minute we have
our virtual machine ready I'm going into
that resource and I'm going to copy this
IP address
all right I have already appeared into
this virtual machine the first thing
that I'm going to do is I'm going to
install IIs server on this virtual
machine so let me do that now
all right our web server is ready now
let me close this for installing the
application that I've shown you earlier
this application this is a.net 3.1
application for installing this you
should have net hosting bundle installed
on this virtual machine
for that I'm going into Internet
Explorer for downloading it and before
that I'm going to local server and I'm
disabling enhanced security
configuration here and let me go to uh
Internet Explorer
um
right here we have
a hosting bundle
all right now I'm going into
my IIs server here is server manager and
sites and let me go into the uh the
directory and I'm going to clear this
directory
and then I'm going into my visual studio
let me
do a publish and for that I will have to
create a new published profile I'm going
with this fold option
and this fold is okay for me let me
finish it and click publish
all right
now if I go into that folder you will
see the SE things here and if I go into
publish we have the uh the things that
we can deploy into our IIs to run this
application
so let me do that now
I'm going to copy it
and I'm going to share it basically I'm
going to paste it
inside here and then I'm going to
extract it like this now if I try to
access this website here
as you can see we are getting the
machine name
of the social machine now we have
successfully deployed IIs and our sample
application in this virtual machine the
next step is creating a image from the
social machine and for that let me close
all these windows
and then I'm going into this PC and C
drive and windows
and system 32 folder and here we'll have
to find
a tool called sysprep this will prepare
a VM to be used as a image this setting
I'm going to keep it as it is I'm going
to click generalize because
generalization of this Photoshop machine
is what we want to achieve
so let me click on shutdown this is what
happens after the VM is ready now let me
click ok
in around one to two minutes you will
see this message when you see this you
can go back to your Azure portal and
here you can stop that virtual machine
if it is running now let me click
refresh here and I'm going to stop it
now it's time for us to create the image
let me click on capture
and then I don't want to share this on
image gallery and then
um yeah all these options are looking
okay for me because this is not our end
goal so let me click on review and
create and this will create the image
for us
now our image is ready let me click on
go to resource
as you can see we have the option to
create a new virtual machine with this
image
and I'm going back into my Resource
Group as you can see we have many
resources
along with our image the only thing that
we need from now on in this video is the
image because of that I'm going to
delete all other resources from this
Resource Group
all right now that we have a clean
Resource Group it is time for us to
create our
skill set for that let me search for
scale set and click create
here I'm going to name this vmss one and
region southeast Asia is okay for me and
all these configuration here I'm going
to keep it as it is
and here
you will see the image if you're not
seeing it you can go to see all images
and my images and here you will see the
image that we have just created
and you can select it
and the size of those VMS so basically
this will create multiple VMS inside of
this scale set this size is okay for me
and then you have to give a username and
password so basically when we
generalized the virtual machine we have
removed all these username password and
this kind of information with Swiss prep
tool since we are pre-deploying those
images now we'll have to give them again
now let me select the license type pass
well
we have an option to enable load
balancer here as well but I will be
doing that
separately so here when it comes to
scaling I don't want this to
automatically scale we have an option to
configure that here as well the initial
instance count I'm going to keep as 2
and then validation is passed let me
click create here all right as you can
see we have deployed our vision scale
set now let me go to Resource and here
you will see some information as you can
see we don't have a public IP address
and if you go to instances you will see
the two instances of that virtual
machine scale set basically the two VMS
and one of them is still updating State
let me click refresh here now as you can
see they're both running
now it is time for us to create the load
balancer to route
the web traffic to these VMS and get our
response for that let me go to the
resource Group again
and I'm going to create a load balancer
let me click on Create and search for
load
balancer
um yeah we are not getting it let me
search for it
um
okay then let's
yeah here we have the load balancer
service so let me click on create
and I'm going to name it name it my lb1
and the reason I'm going to keep it as
it is it is going to be a public one not
an internal load balancer basically we
are going to access it from the public
internet so for that for this one I'm
going to keep it as a standard one and
it is not going to be Global load
balancer now the next thing is since we
are accessing it from the public
internet we have to
add this front-end IP configuration
um right let me call it f5p and let me
create a new IP address
my public IP address
and then I'm going to click ok
so we have completed our front-end IP
configuration the next step is back-end
pools
for this let me add virtual Network
and then
here you have two options you have you
can add virtual machines directly and
you can add virtual machine skill sets
as well now I'm going to select the
scale set that we have created the IP
address as well of that and I see now
let me add this as you can see we have
the two virtual machine instances listed
under back and full one now let me go
into inbound rules we are writing a rule
that will route our HTTP traffic that
hits Auto balancer to our virtual
machines for that I'm going to click ADD
alert balancer rule
let me call it rule one
and ipv4 front-end IP address is the one
that we have just created
and Port is 80 and the back end port is
also 80. now backend pool is the one
that we are creating and we have to
create a health probe for that let me
call it health
probe one
and the protocol is HTTP is okay and
Port 80 and part is the root interval is
every 5 Seconds
unhealthy threshold is two these are all
okay for me let me click ok
now I don't want any session persistence
and all these configurations are okay
for me let me click add here
I'll write our inbound rules are ready
and here you can configure out one rules
as well but that's
not needed
for this
demo now let me click create as you can
see our load balancer is ready now let's
go to this load balancer and see the
configurations
and if you go here to front-end IP
configurations you will see this IP here
if you try to access it
as you can see we are not able to access
our virtual machines
so what we are missing here is that we
haven't had the NSG row to our virtual
machine interface cards
so now let me go to that Resource Group
again and then I'm going into so
basically if you look here we have one
network security group
and if you go inside of that security
group and if you go into interfaces you
will see that both of my virtual machine
interface cards are connected to this
network security group and if you go to
inbound security rules here you won't
see any rule here that allows HTTP
traffic to it and because of that let me
add a rule here as you can see here I'm
going to keep all these settings as
default but you can you should do it if
it is a production environment you
should uh maybe add this virtual Network
only or this IP address only
so let me go and change this service to
http because that is what we are trying
to access let me click add all right as
you can see we have our Network Security
Group ready now let me go back to this
Tab and reload it
see it is still not working because you
have to wait for some time for this uh
this change that we have done to uh to
affect the virtual Network so let's wait
for some time and see what happens
all right I've been waiting here for
some time but it is still not working
let's um troubleshoot why this happens
um so let me go into this virtual
machine scale set and instances here you
will see the uh this message saying not
the latest model
so we'll have to upgrade this virtual
machine to the latest model so for that
I'm going into each of those VMS and I'm
going to click upgrade here
all right we have upgraded the first
virtual machine now let me go back to
the list and let's try to refresh it
no issues there and uh
let's upgrade this one as well all right
now let's go back and try to see whether
this works yeah as you can see we are
getting this message and if you look
here we are getting the computer name
because that's what we are returning
from our SB donate application as you
can see this is the name
so let's see what happens if I go ahead
and maybe restart this virtual machine
let's wait for some time
as you can see I'm getting a service
unavailable one as well and then we are
getting
the response from our next virtual
machine if you have any questions or
comments let me know down below please

something new today and thanks for
