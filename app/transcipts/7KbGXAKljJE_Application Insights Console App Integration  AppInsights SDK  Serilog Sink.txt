today I'm going to show you how to
integrate your console application with
your application insights resource and I
have here my application insights
resource created let me go to my visual
studio and show you how you can
integrate your console application with
your application insights resource so
this is my visual studio here
I have created in two projects in the
first one I'm going to show you how to
directly integrate with
um application insights using direct
sdks and here I'm going to show you how
to use sir log and integrate to your
application insights with fertilog which
is easier but I'm going to show you this
one so that you know how to do it first
of all we need to install some packages
to um to our project
and I'll be attaching these codes code
snippet in the description below so you
can use it
and then add this
using statements here and then we are
going to add this service collection
because we don't have a dependency
injection setup in our control
application
that's why I am doing it and there's one
thing that you should understand and
that is the server Telemetry Channel
there are two um
Elementary channels that you can use one
is in memory and one is server
television this is the more advanced one
than in memory so basically what these
do is that this works as a buffer for
your locks you can configure the uh the
time that it it should take for sync uh
sync your logs to application device
thank you
thank you
and and here I'm doing uh here I have
a completed setting up all the objects
that I need for do the logging and then
um you know file Loop I'm I'm doing
logging here before going forward I need
to add my application insights key here
so let me copy it
and paste it here
now let's run this application all the
code here will be attached in the
description below so that you can use it
so as you can see it's writing to
application insights
in this for Loop now let's go to my
application in files resource on azure
see whether it works
if I go here to blocks
I'm not seeing anything because it
usually takes few minutes for
application insights to show your logs
so let's wait for some time
all right now as you can see we have um
the logs that we wrote in application
insights so uh so let's add this
order by
so that uh we are seeing the latest ones
okay nice so let's uh go back to my
visual studio and stop this application
and now let's try to try this the same
thing with serilog which which is the uh
the recommended approach because you can
there are many many features that you
can use
um when you're using serolog for example
the concept of syncs
um with that you can connect to
um you can use many other log handlers
it could be um it doesn't have to be
application inside it's going to be a
console console or it could be a text
file or it could be a table storage
as you can see here there are many uh
syncs available with Siri log so so
let's go back to my application and
install the packages we need to
integrate with cellulog so these are the
packages that I'm going to install
as you can see I'm going to install this
Microsoft package and then all the
Sherlock ones
um basically this is you need this
package and one of these packages so for
this example I'm using these all these
three things the console one the filed
one and and the one that we are going to
mainly focus on today that is
application insights so um so let's
install these packages
all right now let's add the uh the using
statements
that we need and then at the code is the
code snippet so here as you can see
um
I can just add and remove these things
easily you can just uh it's a fluent API
if you want if you don't want a file or
console logs you can just remove it but
I'm going to add this for you this
example you need this insights key which
we could get from application insights
so let's go back to my application
insights resource and copy
the instrumentation key and paste it
here
all right
now let's let's run this and see how it
how it works
yeah as you can see
um unlike before we are seeing the logs
in the console because we have added
this console here and we have added this
file
um sync as well let's see whether that
works
so I'm going to go to my uh my directory
of of the project
as you can see I'm seeing the the logs
in the file as well now let's go to my
application insights resource and see
um the logs
you'll have to wait for some time
because it takes few minutes for this to
get updated let's wait
all right now we are seeing the logs
from our
um sorry lock Library
as you can see we have used direct SDK
and serloc for integrating with
application insights Ser log is the the
recommended approach for doing this
because you have many options and you
don't have to get lost with the channels
and things like that if you have any
questions you can leave them below and
if you want to be updated with what I'm
doing you can subscribe to my channel as
well and thanks for watching
