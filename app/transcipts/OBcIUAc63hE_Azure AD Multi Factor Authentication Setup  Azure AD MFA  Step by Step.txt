hello everyone
if you're only using a password to
authenticate a user it leaves an
insecure Vector for an attack multifact
authentication is the process where a
user is prompted during the sign-in
process for an additional forms of
identification and today we are going to
learn how to configure multi-factor
authentication on Azure ad I'm in my
Azure ad default directory and I'm going
to click users and add a new user
so I'm going to select create a new user
and I'm going to give a name to call it
John Doe
and I'm going to add a password
like this
and then I'm going to keep all these
settings as default and create the user
as you can see the user is ready now let
me show you
that you can log in with that user
I'm going into that user and
and we'll copy this and I'm going to
paste it here
as you can see I have logged in
successfully now let me go back to my
Azure portal and enable multi-factor
Authentication
there are many ways of enabling
multi-factor authentication for users
and one way is user by user basis and
for that I'm going in to my default
directory
and security section here
and inside of this security section this
menu item called MFA I'm going to select
that and I'm going to click additional
cloud-based MFS settings and I'm going
into this users tab here
as you can see I have my new user and
multi-factor authentication status is
disabled there are three statuses here
disabled enabled and enforced
if you enable it the user has an option
to add multi-factor authentication for
his account and if you enforce it user
must have configured multi-factor
authentication for his account
so I'm going to select this user and
click this button here to enable it and
it is asking me whether I should enable
this
awesome I've just enabled it now let me
go back to a new incognito window
all right
let me paste the name
and insert the password
and as you can see I'm getting a message
here to enable multi-factor
authentication for my car hope you
