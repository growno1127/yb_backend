hello everyone in this video I'm gonna
show you how to create a file share on
your local machine from Azure storage
files for that the first thing that I
have to do is creating a storage account
on Azure I have created this script to
do that first I'm going to deploy this
Resource Group and then this storage
account so let me copy all these
commands and run on my Azure Powershell
as you can see the resource is ready now
let me go to Azure portal and click
refresh here
I'm going into the resource Group and
the search account
and in that storage account I'm going
into file shares section here
and then I'm going to add a file share
so let me click on ADD
and I'm going to name it let's say file
share1
and I want this to be a hot tier and
here you will see the maximum iOS and
egress and Ingress rates and maximum
capacity and also information about
large files and all that I'm going to
click create all right my file shy is
ready now let me go into that
and I'm going to click connect as you
can see I can select a drive letter I'm
going to keep this as it is and then I'm
going to use storage account key
authentication for this you can use
active directory authentication as well
I'm going to copy these commands here
let me click copy now I'm going into
Powershell and I'm going to paste this
script here as you can see I have a 5
terabyte drive mapped to my local
machine now let me go to Windows
Explorer and as you can see we have it
here and now I'm going into it
and let me add a file to this drive now
this file is on Azure if we go back to
Azure portal and click refresh
as you can see I have just uploaded my
file to Azure file share hope you
